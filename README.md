# Automation
Scripts of varying types including Applescript, PowerShell, Python and Shell scripts

# Description
Now days, automation is incredibly important for anyone using technology.  Simple, time-saving tasks, that can be linked together.  The purpose is to figure out ways of saving time.

You'll find, over time, a good number of examples of what I use including:
* DevonThink Actions and Templates - DevonThink is one of the best applications I've ever used, and is akin to something like EverNote.  It's the "bread and butter" of my technical sanity.
* Automated build and deploy scripts - I'm a C# developer, and there are times when I want to deploy tasks without blocking my current editing environment.  This could be to test, to build a docker container, whatever.
* Folder actions - I like to share what I write up.  Most of these are done in DevonThink, but many coworkers are using other operating systems.  So storing information to OneDrive for publishing as a share for other people.
* API Calls to various systems - I'm a big user of Visual Studio Online, and my team uses OneNote.  Part of this is being able to pull information from those two areas and use them in my own workflow
* Inter-App Applescript - I'm a mac user.  I use a lot of mac-only apps to get work done.  Including stuff like OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, DevonThink, DevonAgent, and OmniFocus.  Applescript is a good way to get many apps to talk together.

Each folder will have a README that describes the folder.  In general, most scripts won't be something you can simply download and use.  Some, yes, will work that way but many won't.  API keys, authentication information, etc - all of that won't be included here.  I'll do my best to denote when it's needed vs not.
